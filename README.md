# KIM-Data-Science-Portfolio
This repository is for data science projects required for the Introduction to Data Science course and will be updated accordingly. 

## 1. Portfolio Update #1: Interactive Palmers Penguins Dataset
This streamlit app displays the Palmers Penguins dataset and allows filtering the data interactively. User can filter data by species, island, and bill length. 

## 2. Portfolio Update #2: Beijing Olympic Medalist Tidy Data
The notebook aims to demonstrate how to import, tidy, and visualize data from the [**2008 Summer Olympic Games**](https://edjnet.github.io/OlympicsGoNUTS/2008/). It walks through the process of reshaping the original dataset (which is in a wide format) into a long format that adheres to the principles of tidy data. This transformation makes the data easier to filter, group, and analyze using the Pandas library. 

**What is Tidy Data**
Tidy data is a way of organizing data that makes it easier to analyze and visualize. It follows a specific structure that is consistent and predictable, making data manipulation more straightforward. Tidy data is important because it makes data analysis and visualization more efficient and intuitive. Reference: [**Tidy Data**](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)

*The key principles of tidy data include the following:*
- Each variable forms a column: Every column in the dataset represents a specific variable or attribute.
- Each observation forms a row: Every row contains a single observation or record.
- Each type of observational unit forms a cell: Different types of data (e.g., athletes, events, results) are stored in separate cells.

In short, tidy data makes the data analysis process more organized, reliable, and efficient!
